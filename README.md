Scrum Agile Development Final Project


How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Communicate with the user, I would ask meaningful interrogative questions. I would attempt to conduct a thorough survey of the user, so that the user will give
their input ( their "user story). By accomplishing this and staying in constant communication with them. We should deliver a top notch program for them.



How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

After a thourougj study of the Scrum/Agile approach to Software Development and how it compares to other frameworks.
I hope to participate in using this framework to create useful software.



What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Besides all the common sense stuff like being respectful and maintaining good relationships and accountable. I would continually refine my skills so I could be cross functional. In doing this I would be able to serve my teamates and be someone they could rely on for support.
